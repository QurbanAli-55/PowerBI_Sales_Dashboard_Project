# PowerBI_Sales_Dashboard_Project
AoA!
Internship project

Excited to share my 2nd internship project in 👨‍💼Sales Analytics, a dynamic assignment from Skill Genie📊

I had the privilege to assist an organization in its quest to enhance Sales performance and reduce attrition through the power of Sales Analytics.

🔍 I used Power BI to create a dynamic Sales Analytics dashboard with charts including 👨‍💼 Human Resources, 🔍 Research and 📈 Development, and Sales.

 Here's a glimpse of the insightful metrics we analyzed:

 Hours Count: Providing an overview of the workforce in each sales problem.

 Hours Rate: Highlighting the average Sales of a company in each problem.

 Average Years in the Company: Unveiling the tenure of employees in each sale.

But the insights didn't stop there! We delved deeper into specifics:

Impacts

Enhancing talent management is pivotal for organizational success. Our data-driven approach empowers business teams to make informed decisions, boosting sales satisfaction and slashing rates.

Organizations can proactively address the main points identified in our analysis to foster a more productive and positive work environment. 🤝

 Gratitude and Growth!

This experience has been truly amazing, enriching my knowledge base and offering practical insights. I extend my sincere thanks to Skill Genie for this invaluable opportunity. Excited to continue working on fantastic projects and expanding my horizons. 🙏
